# ColoringMockup

This is testing some ideas of coloring math for dyslexia. This is just a mockup and only supports linear text. The goal is to bring this into MathShare.

To try this, visit https://nsoiffer.github.io/ColoringMockup/ to create rules and https://nsoiffer.github.io/ColoringMockup/try-it.html for having others try the rules you create.
See instructions in the first link on how to save the rules and give them to others.
